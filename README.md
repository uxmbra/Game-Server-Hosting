# ðŸŽ® **Game Server Hosting** ðŸŽ® 

This is my own personal project regarding hosting games, services and just about anything that can be ran on Pelican Panel.

The server setup is using Pelican Panel on a VPS host which is the only front facing part, then we have the Pelican Wing based off my home server, with a N2N VPN tunnel between the two, along with a hairpin nat to allow the websockets to work on the Pelican Panel consoles.
