# **N2N SETUP** 

## Overview
This is how the N2N VPN tunnel is setup between the two machines, the VPS (Machine 1) is the Supernode, whilist my Home server (Machine 2) is just connecting to the supernode.

(I will write the actual setup soon when I can be bothered converting my many txt files of scribble and babble into understandable words.)
